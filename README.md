### User Story:
AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform

I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API

SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem

### Requirements:

GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state

WHEN I review the appâ€™s store

THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API

WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store

THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider

WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state

THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API

WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store

THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API

WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions

THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
